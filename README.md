## Smart Contract Functions

### **1. Register Member**
Allows new users to register with a unique profile.
```clarity
(register-member (nickname (string-ascii 50)) (bio (string-ascii 100)) (preferences (string-ascii 200)))
```

**Parameters**:
- `nickname`: A unique nickname for the member.
- `bio`: A brief biography.
- `preferences`: Additional user preferences.

**Returns**: Confirmation of registration or an error if the nickname already exists.

---

### **2. Update Profile**
Enables members to modify their profile details.
```clarity
(update-profile (bio (string-ascii 100)) (preferences (string-ascii 200)) (visibility (bool)))
```

**Parameters**:
- `bio`: Updated biography.
- `preferences`: Updated preferences.
- `visibility`: Boolean to control profile visibility.

**Returns**: Confirmation of the update or an error.

---

### **3. View Member Profile**
Retrieves the details of a member's profile.
```clarity
(get-profile (nickname (string-ascii 50)))
```

**Parameters**:
- `nickname`: The unique nickname of the member.

**Returns**: Profile details or an error if the member does not exist.

---

### **4. Delete Member**
Allows the `CONTRACT-OWNER` to delete a member profile.
```clarity
(delete-member (nickname (string-ascii 50)))
```

**Parameters**:
- `nickname`: The unique nickname of the member to be deleted.

**Returns**: Confirmation of deletion or an error if the member does not exist.

---

## Access Control

- **CONTRACT-OWNER**:  
  Has admin privileges to manage all members.
- **Members**:  
  Can only manage their own profiles and control visibility settings.

---

## Error Handling

The contract implements comprehensive error handling to ensure robust operations. Common errors include:
- **Duplicate Nicknames**: Registration fails if the nickname is already taken.
- **Unauthorized Access**: Non-members or unauthorized users cannot access restricted functions.
- **Invalid Data**: Profile updates fail if provided data exceeds defined limits.

---

## Usage Examples

### Registering a New Member
```clarity
(register-member 'john-doe "John Doe" "I love coding and blockchain.")
```

### Updating a Profile
```clarity
(update-profile "Updated bio" "Updated preferences" true)
```

### Viewing a Member's Profile
```clarity
(get-profile 'john-doe)
```

### Deleting a Member (Admin Only)
```clarity
(delete-member 'john-doe)
```

## Testing

Use Clarinet to test the contract:
1. Run tests locally:
   ```bash
   clarinet test
   ```
2. Review the test reports for any errors or failed cases.

---

## Security Considerations

- Ensure only the `CONTRACT-OWNER` can delete member profiles.
- Validate all user inputs to prevent data corruption.
- Test for edge cases and handle them gracefully.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add multi-language support for member profiles.
- Implement advanced role-based permissions.
- Integrate with external storage systems for larger datasets.
